## August 2025

During development of Slop Fountain a side project began.

Questions of attribution continue to nag. Some appropriate decisions have been made.

Project bibli began as a json itch. Influenced by close childhood friendship with Pears Clopedia. Origin story below.

## Latest 

A collection of slops appeared refreshing terminals looking for fun.

The excuse was I was brushing up my js worker script skills. 

The world needs more native JS workers say the Deno guys who stripped typescript from their core. :popcorn:

## mips slop

Yet another side project, we spin up an R3000 tool chain and emulator from first principles...

Inspired by this guy [https://dmitry.gr](https://dmitry.gr) who runs emulators in very cool corners.

The crosstool-ng project was used to build bare metal MIPS toolchain. 

In case anyone is timing it took my pi5 with m2 storage less than 15 minutes to build complete C++ mips tool chain.

So yes, I learned many things, not including how much more there is to learn (unlearnable).

Claude Sonnet made me feel special, nice one Sonnet. 

It was cool to write some fresh bat files to check out entire github account and get such a positive first pass on some of my better bits.

Note to self: when I retire I am going to come back to my old code.
