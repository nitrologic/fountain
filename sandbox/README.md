# mips sandbox

I wrote a Java VM for Playstation 1 in 1996

I was hoping to effect a home computer using the action replay cartridge and a ps2 keybord adapter I had prototyped with a Scenix SX28.

Java was from the future and the MIPS processors were straight out of Jurassic Park.

The crosstool-ng project was used to build bare metal MIPS toolchain.
